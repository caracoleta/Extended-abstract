\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The air transport market has suffered significant transformations over the last decades, driven by the
liberalization of the industry, which started in 1978 when the United States of America (USA) deregulated
its domestic airline market, meaning airlines were free to set their own fares and routes, without federal
control. This new regulatory framework without market entry
barriers and market restrictions, marked the beginning of an era of unprecedented air traffic growth, where the number of passengers in the world increased from 310 million in 1970 to 4.5 billion in 2019 \cite{baltagi1995}\cite{worldevolution}.

Central to this evolution was the emergence and expansion of Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs). Around 2002, less than 10 years after the implementation of the third package of the EU liberalization process, a steep growth of LCCs started, reaching
30.3\% of the market share in 2018, 10 times more than in 2002 \cite{sharelcc}. Initially operating mostly from secondary or regional airports, in order to reduce operating costs,
LCCs gradually expanded their operations to larger airports, and are now competing directly with legacy
airlines at major hub airports \cite{jimenez2020}. This strategic shift of LCCs towards larger airports highlights
the dynamic nature of the air transport market and the consequent need of constant benchmarking to evaluate the performance of airports and adapt accordingly to the changing market conditions. This need for performance analysis is further intensified by the increasing trend towards business
models such as privatization and the use of concessions for airport management, as regulation by public
entities and stakeholders requires transparent and objective performance metrics.

Benchmarking has become a fundamental tool to evaluate the performance across a wide range of
industries and represents a systematic comparison of the performance of different entities, which usually
transform the same kind of inputs into similar outputs.


Motivated by the decision of developing a new airport in Lisbon, the present work aims to benchmark the efficiency of 41 Iberian airports (5 Portuguese and 36 Spanish) from 2016 to
2023 and identify exogenous factors that influence airport efficiency, such as rail intermodal terminals.
